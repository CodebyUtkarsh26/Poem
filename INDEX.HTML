    <h1>One Day, Maybe</h1>
    <p>Every morning I wake with a whisper of hope,</p>
    <p>That today might be the day you finally know.</p>
    <p>I carry a smile, but it hides the ache,</p>
    <p>Of a heart that beats only for your sake.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I see you in school, so close yet far,</p>
    <p>And wonder what flaw keeps you from my heart’s star.</p>
    <p>I ask myself, with eyes that search the sky,</p>
    <p>What is it in me that makes even God deny?</p>
    <br>

    <p>You’re angry with me, I can feel it still,</p>
    <p>But my love for you bends to no storm or will.</p>
    <p>It stands like a tree through seasons of pain,</p>
    <p>Rooted in faith, through sunshine and rain.</p>
    <br>

    <p>So many times, I whisper, “Go talk to her today,”</p>
    <p>But the moment I see you, my words fade away.</p>
    <p>My mind goes silent, my courage hides,</p>
    <p>Like a wave that retreats from the shore it slides.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Old chats flash back like a thunderstorm’s cry,</p>
    <p>Each word a raindrop that clouds my eye.</p>
    <p>But I hold the tears and clench back tight,</p>
    <p>Telling myself, “One day, she’ll see the light.”</p>
    <br>

    <p>I love you today, like I did from the start,</p>
    <p>With no expectations, just a loyal heart.</p>
    <p>Even if you don’t feel the same way yet,</p>
    <p>I’ll wait, I’ll love — without regret.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Because maybe one day, you'll turn around,</p>
    <p>And find in me what others never found.</p>
    <p>Till then I’ll live, with this quiet flame,</p>
    <p>Hoping one day… you’ll call out my name.</p>
    <br>
